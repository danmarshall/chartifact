# Chartifact

**Declarative, interactive data documents**

Chartifact is a low-code document format for creating interactive, data-driven pages such as reports, dashboards, and presentations. It travels like a document and works like an app. Easily editable and remixable, itâ€™s a file type for an AI-native world.

## Features


This extension works with two file formats: `*.idoc.md` and `*.idoc.json`.

### Create Documents
- **Explorer View**: Right-click on a folder and select "New Interactive Document (JSON)" or "New Interactive Document (Markdown)".

### Preview Documents
- **Explorer View**: Right-click on a `*.idoc.md` or `*.idoc.json` file and select "Preview Interactive Document".
- **Editor Title Bar**: Open a document and select "Preview Interactive Document (Split View)" for side-by-side editing and previewing.

### Edit Documents
- **Explorer View**: Right-click on a `*.idoc.md` or `*.idoc.json` file and select "Edit Document with the GUI".

### Convert Documents
- **Explorer View**: Convert between formats:
  - "Convert to HTML" for sharing standalone files.
  - "Convert to Markdown" for easier collaboration.

These features make it simple to create, preview, edit, and share interactive documents directly within VS Code.
