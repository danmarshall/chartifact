# interactive-documents

Declarative interactive data documents.

Create data-driven reports, dashboards, presentations and interactive content that combines rich text, visualizations, and user controls. An interactive document format built with AI-first principles - designed to be easily understood and generated by both humans and LLMs. 

We believe there's a spectrum from static documents to dynamic apps, and we're carving out valuable middle ground. Our philosophy centers on the enduring power of file formats - shareable, portable, and durable across time and platforms. Not every user experience needs custom development; there's tremendous power in a standard catalog of composable components that work together predictably. This catalog can expand over time while maintaining backward compatibility, giving creators both immediate productivity and long-term confidence in their content.

## AI Assist

The document format is optimized for AI assistance in authoring tools:

- **VS Code integration**: Press Ctrl+I in the document editor for AI-powered assistance
- **VS Code agent mode**: Let VS Code's AI agent help structure and populate your documents
- **GUI chat participant**: Coming soon - conversational AI for the visual editor
- **SEO optimization**: AI-enhanced HTML wrapper generation for search and bot friendliness

## Getting Started

Interactive documents can be created, edited, and shared through multiple interfaces:

### VS Code Extension
The primary authoring environment with full-featured editing capabilities:
- **Document authoring**: Create and edit interactive documents in both JSON and Markdown formats
- **Preview on save**: File watcher automatically updates preview when you save your documents
- **Visual editor**: Graphical interface for building documents through forms and controls
- **HTML export**: Generate standalone HTML files that recipients can open without installing anything

### Web Interface
Browser-based tools accessible at our GitHub Pages site:
- **Viewer**: Drop or paste your documents for instant viewing and interaction
- **GUI editor**: Web-based visual editor for creating documents online

The VS Code extension provides the most comprehensive authoring experience, while the web interface offers convenient sharing and quick editing capabilities.

## Authoring Formats

Interactive documents can be authored in two formats, depending on your preference:

- **JSON format**: Structured data format for programmatic creation and complex documents
- **Markdown format**: Human-readable text format for easier authoring and collaboration

Both formats support the same interactive elements and capabilities, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your workflow.

## Security

Interactive documents prioritize security through multiple layers of protection:

- **Vega-powered**: Built on Vega's expression language and visualization grammar, which provides the low-code foundation and brings CSP compliance out of the box
- **No arbitrary code**: The format is low-code by design - no custom JavaScript or arbitrary code execution allowed
- **CSP compliant**: Content Security Policy compatible for safe embedding in secure environments
- **Iframe sandbox**: Documents are rendered in isolated iframe sandboxes, ensuring user content cannot access or modify the parent page
- **Safe sharing**: Provides a secure environment for sharing and executing interactive documents while maintaining strict security boundaries

## Interactive Elements

Interactive documents support a variety of element types:

- **Checkbox**: Boolean value controls with labels
- **Chart**: Vega and Vega-Lite visualizations for data analysis
- **CSS**: Custom styling blocks for document appearance and layout
- **Dropdown**: Single or multi-select dropdowns with static or dynamic options
- **Image**: Dynamic images that can update based on user interactions
- **Markdown**: Rich text content with formatting, dynamic placeholders like `{{variable_name}}`, and dynamic URLs. Supports headers, emphasis, lists, links, tables, code blocks, and custom CSS styling while maintaining security by not supporting HTML tags
- **Presets**: Pre-configured sets of variable values for quick scenario switching
- **Slider**: Numeric range controls with min/max/step values
- **Table**: Interactive tabular data display with sorting, filtering, and selection
- **Textbox**: Text input fields

All interactive elements are defined using JSON structures, whether authored directly in JSON format or within JSON code blocks in Markdown documents.

## Architecture & Data Flow

Interactive documents feature a reactive architecture that seamlessly handles data and user interactions:

- **REST API compatibility**: Built-in support for fetching data from REST endpoints with reactive variables that automatically reload URLs when parameters change
- **Vega transformations**: Leverage Vega's powerful data transformation pipeline for filtering, aggregating, and reshaping data without custom code
- **Reactive updates**: All elements automatically update when variables change, creating smooth interactive experiences
- **Dynamic URLs**: Image URLs and API endpoints can include variables that trigger automatic reloading when user inputs change
- **Signal Bus coordination**: Internal message bus that glues components together, ensuring synchronized state across all interactive elements
- **Jupyter notebook integration**: Serves as an excellent UI layer for Jupyter notebooks, bringing interactivity to data science workflows
